# Nx Workspace: emartnx

This repository contains an Nx workspace named "emartnx" with Node.js projects.


## STEP-1:Creating an Nx Workspace

```bash
"npx create-nx-workspace" OR

"npm init nx-workspace" OR

"yarn create nx-workspace" OR

```bash

## STEP-2: Adding Nx to an Existing Repository

cd emartnx

"npx nx@latest init"

## STEP-3: Add New Project

"npx nx generate @nrwl/node:application emartnx-one --project=emartnx"
"npx nx generate @nrwl/node:application emartnx-two --project=emartnx"
"npx nx generate @nrwl/node:application emartnx-three --project=emartnx"
"npx nx generate @nrwl/node:application emartnx-four --project=emartnx"

## STEP-4: Skipping Tests in adding new project

The command you provided:

"npx nx generate @nrwl/node:application emartnx-one --project=emartnx"


is used to generate a new Node.js application named "emartnx-one" within the Nx workspace named "emartnx."

The two folders you mentioned, "emartnx-one" and "emartnx-one-e2e," are typical when generating a new application using Nx. The additional "e2e" folder is for end-to-end (e2e) testing, which is a common practice in software development to ensure that different parts of an application work together correctly.

If you want to skip the generation of e2e tests when generating a new application, you can use the --skipTests option:

"npx nx generate @nrwl/node:application emartnx-one --project=emartnx --skipTests"

This will generate only the main application without the corresponding end-to-end tests. Adjust the command according to your preferences and project requirements.




## STEP-5: git init

## STEP-6: git add .


## STEP-7: git commit -m "Initial commit"


## STEP-8: git remote add origin <repository-url>


## STEP-9: git push -u origin master
